# 3D-Scene
Approaching software design feels like crafting a captivating story. In my recent project, I aimed for a 3D scene that blends simplicity with complexity, using shaders to play with visual aesthetics. The design process involved creating user-friendly navigation, akin to crafting an intuitive interface for readers. Custom functions, like `mouse_callback` and `scroll_callback`, serve as well-crafted plot twists, enhancing the user experience. Looking forward, I see these design tactics as templates for future projects, and the modular code structure as a foundation for organized storytelling.

In terms of developing programs, coding is like refining the prose to bring the story to life. The 3D scene's development strategies, including iterative processes and adjustable features, mirror the writing process of multiple drafts and revisions. Throughout the milestones, my coding approach evolved. Computer science serves as the creative toolkit, empowering me to construct imaginative worlds and solve intricate problems. Computational graphics and visualizations, akin to illustrations in a book, enhance both my educational and professional pathways, providing unique storytelling skills that set me apart in the professional landscape.
